DESIGN PATTERN ASSIGNMENT                                                                  Week 18

Primary Problem: Validating & then sorting the cards by type

Secondary Problem(s): Reading from file 

Design Patterns: I would implement a Factory Pattern because I am not sure what class to implement ahead of time, so I want to return one of several possible classes 
    (CreditCard-type) & that all possible outcome are children of the same superclass (CreditCard)

Consequences:  The consequences of using Factory as a creation method means we will be relying on a virtual constructor
